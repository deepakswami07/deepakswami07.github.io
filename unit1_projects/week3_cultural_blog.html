                         <p class="questions">When I was initially checking out different boot camps, I would come across graphs and charts whereby various boot camps would do a comparison of others around the country.  They would list the things you would learn, how proficient you would be after you complete their course and what a committed group of faculty worked at their boot camp.  It felt like they were selling a product.  On one such website, I read a blog where the person mentioned Dev Boot Camp in comparison.  This is how I discovered DBC.  So I checked the DBC website. After watching the opening video on DBC site, I was sold!  DBC had an educational philosophy that was at the core of the institution, learning coding was secondary.  This was something that was missing in most other boot camps.  Most of them were selling a product.</p>
                    
                         <p class="questions">As an educator, I believe you can learn anything, if a safe learning environment is created.  I have seen this firsthand as a teacher. In a safe learning environment you are willing to take risks, you are not afraid to say "I don't know" and you don't hold back on questions that you think will be embarrassing.  And yet, I was fearful of moving into the world of coding. I am new to coding and I am fearful on a daily basis of the outcome of this change. Watching Shareef again, this time around talk about what he expects us to bring to the table, has been inspiring.  The idea of taking control of your learning is refreshing and yet intimidating, but at the same time the kitchen approach to learning is comforting and supportive.

                         <p class="questions">So far, DBC has been a roller coaster ride of fear and accomplishment.  I can't believe I have coded an html/css web page from a scratch, that I can use command line to do all my file management, writing and uploading, and that I am talking a different language filled with vocabulary that was foreign to me a few months ago..  But as I am delving into JavaScript right now, the fear comes back to question if I made the right choice.  But I know soon I will be able to feel comfortable with JavaScript, if I keep my chin up, dig in and reach out for help when I am stuck. Being a part of the DBC community makes me feel safe at times when I get fearful.I am surprised that I have chosen this path to learn coding.  My friends have been nudging me in this direction for many years and I have been resisting this path until I discovered I could be a designer who also codes.  It is just like Dr. Seuss' book Green Eggs and Ham.</p>
                         
                        <p class="questions">In spite of my fears, I am excited!</p>
