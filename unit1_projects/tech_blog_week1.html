                     <p class="questions">
                      <strong>American film institute's</strong> web site is one of the better designed websites thatcatalogseasy to navigate and find any information on any American film. The links are very clearlylaid out on the top. Important events are listed at the bottom. The background is a easy on the eyes grey, the color palette is grey to white,which brings out the colorful film posters and pictures.  The only annoying part is the looping
                      slide shows.  Again, the layout is simple and not cluttered.  There are three things that most want to find when a they visit the site, the catalogs, AFI's Top 100 and events,which you can find on the home page without having to search around.</p>
                      <div id="webpics"><img src="images/AFI.png"></div>
                      
                     
                      <p class="questions"><strong>Indeed.com</strong> is job search site that is widely used by both employers
                       and employees. The guy who started this website used to post printed
                       8X11 sheets of jobs that were available,in groceries stores, bus stops
                       and other public places. When people contacted, him and he would connect
                       them to their potential employers. This was a very simple operation,
                       but a very successful one. This idea of simplicity is applied to the design of the web site as well.
                       There are only three colors used, white for background, blue for important info and orange for links that you need to use in order to complete a search. The are two search windows where you type in the type of job and the location, making it very user friendly. The only issue I have with this website is the "post your resume" section, all the information you need to fill out is on one page, a little pagination would make the process easier, less confusing and make it more user friendly.
                       When you land on their home page, the two windows where you type in the the info for the search is what you see, and it is placed right in the middle of the page. In conclusion, all the three sites from the design point of view were very simple but very effective in reaching to the target audience.</p>

                      <p class="questions"><strong>Greyscalegorilla </strong> is motion graphics/video plugins online store, where you can also find free tutorials for many plugins for 2D and 3D programs.  I really like the site
                      because it is very easy to navigate. The page layout is very simple, they have a logo, important links on the top.  The video, where you can watch tutorials occupies the center of the page. Below the video, there are other links that tell you about the plugin kit. The colors are very easy on your eyes.  If you decide to buy their product, the checkout and downloads are on the same page.  Most importantly there are no advertisements. You can get the same products they sell on other sites, but the simple design is what
                      and easy to navigate is what draws most motion designers to this site.</p>
