                     <p class="questions">
                      Brendan Eich created JavaScript in 1994 when he was working for Netscape Communications. The first version of JavaScript was called Mocha, which was later renamed live script and finally JavaScript.  After many initial incompatibility issues, frustrations and quirks, it gained widespread popularity as a client side scripting language.  With the rise in success as a client-side scripting language, Microsoft introduced JavaScript support on internet Explorer in 1996.  Towards the end of the year, Netscape submitted JavaScript to Ecma International for consideration as an industry standard. A year later, with some modifications, it was released; by the end of 1999, the second and third edition was released. The current edition was released in 2011.</p>

                      What is JavaScript? and what does it have to do with websites?  There are three basic components to web pages; html, css and javascript.  HTML is what gives a web page it structure, like the size of the page, the headings on a page, images and text information in form paragraphs.  CSS is used to stylize the content, like the font, font color, background color etc.  JavaScript makes the webpage interactive.  Before the advent of JavaScript, webpages were static.  You went to webpage, you read the information presented on it and that was it.  There was no way to interact with the page.  What does interact mean?  A simple example of interaction is when you login to check you mail, you enter some information and that information is verified and your email is returned to you.  This interaction is possible because of JavaScript.  So an interactive webpage is more interesting than a static one.  This led to plethora of different ways one could interact, for example take an online quiz, play a game, search of info, buy tickets for events etc.

                      So its no surprise that JavaScript has become one of the most popular programming languages on the web. As more and more professional programmers began using it, it resulted in comprehensive frameworks and libraries; this also resulted in increased server-side use.  The advantages of JavaScript are many; but one of the most important features is that adding JavaScript to a site does not require you to have access to your server—you simply add JavaScript to your web pages and you upload your page.  It also gives you access to some powerful features of the web page.  Before JavaScript, any kind of interaction required sending messages back and forth between browser and server. But with JavaScript, many such interactions can be done at the client-side; this speeds up the page loading time, a very important feature in today’s world of clickers! With ever-increasing number of people who run browsers that can handle JavaScript, the popularity of JavaScript is only getting more popular.</p>
