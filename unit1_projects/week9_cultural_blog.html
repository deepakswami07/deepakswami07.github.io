                     <p class="week">Learning Style Revisited </p>

                         <p class="questions">My thinking style is concrete sequential.  On further researching I found out that most teachers fall into this category.  Having been a teacher for several years I function very well in a structured environment.  I am very practical and also detail oriented.  I like to solve problems in a sequential step-by-step progression. Since a lot of coding problems are solved sequentially and paying attention to detail is also important, I can use these skills to my advantage at DBC. </p>


                         <p class="questions">When I think of everything that I have learned so far at DBC, the two topics that I had difficulty with were JS and SQL.  Now when I look back on why I struggled with these two topics, I see that I was better able to understand Ruby because I had ample time to go over it before coming to DBC.  With JS and SQL I did not spend enough time clearly understanding the basics, especially with SQL which I felt was stuck in with other topics.  This is partly because of the way the lessons were structured but also because of my learning style.  I alway like to learn the basics before a topic is introduced and need time to reflect, but as we were moving from one topic to another it became difficult to reflect and compare. </p>

                         <p class="questions">Even though I have particular type of learning style,I believe there are more ways to learn and my learning style can morph and change.  One change that I have already made and see the benefit is solving problems by pairing. Initially I was very nervous and intimidated by the thought of pairing.  I am a very independent learner, so this change has been an eye opener for me. I am going to use failure as a springboard to explore why I failed and think of other ways of solving the problem or issues I might face when I am at DBC.  My overall approach so far has been irrespective of the the struggles I have with a topic with every passing day I have a better understanding of the topic. </p>
