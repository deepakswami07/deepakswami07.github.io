                     <p class="questions">
                       When I revisited my website again, I realized that there were some issues with regard to positioning.  The cultural page and the technology page needed to be synchronized.  There were three css files which I needed to combine into one file.  The font needed to be changed as well as I had used default sans serif.  I incorporated the feedback I got from two cohort members. Overall, I realized I needed to bring all the pages together in terms of color and style and to make sure it was responsive. </p>
                      
                      <p class="questions">
                      Then I reviewed several websites and checked out jekyl, but decided to manually code both html and css.  I decided to do an in-depth time review.  I took this path to familiarize myself and review what we had learned in week 1 and also to go over topics I had difficulty.</p>

                      <p class="questions">
                      This returns the character number where the match starts.  Or returns true if the match is asking if force is not a part of the string.</p>

                      
                      <p class="questions">
                      The first challenge was very torturous, I had to merge three css files into one and also converted pixels to em, and other dimensions to percent. Once I was done with that, I chose a color theme and played around a bit with positioning to get the desired layout.  I changed the font of the entire site using the 'Lato' google font, which is a sans serif font.  For my main page I wanted some kind of logo that had to something with DBC,  after three different designs, I liked the one with NYC in the background and a the title.  I designed the logo using cinema 4D, a 3D software, this took me another day and a half.</p>

                     
                      <p class="questions">
                      Overall, there is vast improvement in the way it looks and more than the improvement I benefited immensely by coding the entire site.  This has really helped me better understand html and css.  Once I am done with this weeks work, I would like to give it a try with jekyl.</p>
