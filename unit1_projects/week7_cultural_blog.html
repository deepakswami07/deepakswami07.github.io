                     <p class="week">Affirmation and Stereotype Threat</p>

                         <p class="questions">One of the things I like about DBC that makes me feel affirmed is the idea that DBC stresses the value of showing your ignorance and being ok with it. I think that's really important because I think that's where learning starts. When I went back to my 'affirming my values' blog post and related that to what I learned about stereotype threat, I can see that I was really thrown off by the assumption that the interviewers made that I was ignorant about basic concepts and skills that I have been able to achieve and master.  Now I can see that instead of getting caught in the stereotype threat and feeling insulted and frozen, I could remind myself that the interviewers were ignorant about my work and that my task in that moment was to educate them about my skills and to share my achievements with them.</p>


                         <p class="questions">Remembering that both my own ignorance and that of others can be a start to learning is a helpful way to mediate stereotype threat. The other piece of that, which will help at DBC as well, is understanding my learning style which is sometimes very internal and, without verbalizing my thought processes, people could assume I am not engaged because they don't know me or my style. If they don't think I am engaged, it can play into the stereotype threat of the Indian immigrant who has a hard time casually chatting and engaging in conversation.  An exercise I can do at DBC, aside from being more verbal about my thought processes, is to take a break and step away when I am having a hard time solving a problem.</p>
