                     <p class="week">Stereotype Threat</p>

                         <p class="questions">I experienced stereotype threat when I was pursuing positions as a motion graphics designer.  I had the experience of being called in for an interview on the basis of my showreel, which demonstrates my work.  The person who called me for the interview was impressed with my work, and had arranged for me to be interviewed by a hip, off-beat, up-and-coming production company.  I researched the company and had an idea when I arrived for the interview that I would be older than the founding members of their company. I also knew, from my research, that the company was not diverse. It was a group of young, hip, white men.  </p>

                         <p class="questions">When I got to the interview, it seemed as though they had not been expecting me and were not necessarily receptive to my being there. As I said hello, I saw what they were seeing--an older (from their perspective) Indian man with an accent.  From the type of questions they were asking me, I had the sense that they were doubting whether I had actually produced the work in the showreel.  I felt strongly that this was coming from the stereotypes I have experienced before--that Indians are technical but not creative, no fun to hang out with, unable to have a casual conversation, and that Indians with an accent are even more suspect.  I was prepared to talk about each piece of work in my reel, explaining the concept and creative process. Instead, they are checking to see whether I knew the software program I used in producing my work.  As I felt their stereotypes being placed on me, I was thrown off guard and ended up sounding like I didn't know what I was talking about, that I would not be able to have a causal conversation, and that I was no fun at all. In the end I just confirmed their stereotypical expectations. 

                         <p class="questions">If I had to do this differently, I would have been proactive and answered their questions by explaining my creative work first instead of getting caught off-guard by the unexpected questions.  In my own interactions with others, I try to catch myself if I start imagining who or how they might be, based on my assumptions rather than allowing them the freedom to express their individual personalities and talents. To create an inclusive work environment, I don't think we should pretend that stereotypes don't exist within ourselves and others.  Instead, we need to be aware of stereotypes and to educate ourselves about the diversity of experience within and across social identities.</a> </p>
