                     <p class="week">My Son and I</p>

                         <p class="questions">I have a pre-teen son.  He was accepted to a magnet middle school program at the beginning of this year. In previous years, our goal was to get him into the school. I had worked with him and helped him prepare by teaching him study skills and assisting with test preparation.  There would be some conflicts but he would gradually accept what I told him and would follow my game plan.  This year, things changed. He wanted to do things his way. I agreed to this as long as he would come to me when he needed help.  He had a long-term science project and seemed to be on top of things. When I asked him if he needed help he said no.  The weekend before the project was due, it was clear that he was not going to meet the requirements of the project.</p>

                         <p class="questions">This became a family crisis because we were about to go on a trip for the three day week end.  I wanted him to admit that he had messed up in the planning and execution of the project. He refused to admit this, and we butt heads and got stuck on this issue, while the time was quickly passing.  He got upset and so did I, and he went to his room and shut down completely. Since the model he had put together for the project did not work I assumed that he had not done any work or waited until the last minute.  I did not hear him out on all the steps he had actually taken which he was trying to explain. I was so upset that he might fail that I was not listen to him.  We got something completed to hand in but the experience was not pleasant. In reflecting on this conflict, all he wanted me to do was to listen to his side of the story and what he had done in the last two months and why it was not working. I had just assumed that he had not worked on to and it was a last minute effort.</p>

                         <p class="questions">In retrospect, I see that all I had to do was to hear his side of the story and should have asked what his plan was to fix the problem rather than wasting all of that time arguing.  I also see that my reaction is what he might fear when he actually does need to ask for help.</p>
