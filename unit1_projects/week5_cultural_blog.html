                     <p class="week">Green Internet</p>

                         <p class="questions">One of the problems facing the tech world is of environmental sustainability.  People online estimated to be 2.5 billion with this number to increase by 60% in the next 5 years.  According to Greenpeace, data centers will be the fastest growing part of the global IT energy sector footprint, increasing by 81% by 2020. The New York Times estimated that cloud computing consumed 30 billion watts of power a year in 2012, as much power as produced by 30 nuclear power plants.</p>

                         <p class="questions">The average utilization rate for severs ranges from 5 to 15 percent  which means that many companies are paying energy costs to run data centers at 100 percent capacity but are only using 5-15 percent of that capacityâ€”a waste of energy and resources.  From the issue of the energy required to build and maintain cloud storage to ones of efficient utilization of data centers and server farms, the higher demand for energy has an environmental impact that the tech industry is beginning to address.</p>

                         <p class="questions">The good news is that IT companies can be leaders in turning towards renewable energy to power the Internet creating a Green Internet.  The use renewable energy is good for the environment and good for companies in that the costs of renewable energy are dropping just as those of fossil fuels are rising. Greenpeace has brought attention to these issues and reports that 6 major cloud brands Apple, Box, Facebook, Google, Rackspace and Salesforce, have all committed to a goal of powering data centers with 100% renewable energy.  Ideas on better utilization of data centers and service farms are being generated by companies such as EMC. The tech industry has been a leader in innovation and this attention within the industry towards environmental sustainability has the potential to generate a new set of innovative practices that can create a Green Internet.</a> </p>
