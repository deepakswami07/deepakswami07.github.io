                     <p class="week">Pairing and Giving Feedback</p>

                         <p class="questions">Throughout the program, I have had feelings of fear and insecurity as to whether I can keep up with my partner. The further I get into the program, the more I am able to manage these feelings by remembering that this is a learning process, that we all have different approaches to learning, and that it is ok to be a work in progress. I am becoming more confident in some of skills I have mastered while I am mindful that there is so much more to learn from the materials and from my peers.</p>


                         <p class="questions">Kind, actionable and specific feedback is feedback that helps people grow.  Although it is a little intimidating to get feedback, when it is given in a kind way, with specifics, it can be used in action to improve myself.  When I tell people from other fields about this aspect of the program, they are envious that this type of feedback is not given in their workplace or educational setting and that instead that feedback is rare or negative or vague.  I especially value this part of the program and I have found that giving and receiving this type of feedback helps me grow more attuned to how I impact those around me and how they impact me.</p>

                         <p class="questions">My feelings of vulnerability during pairing and feedback are related to the fear and insecurity I described in the beginning of this blog. In the beginning I thought feedback would be emailed to me and then later realized that I had to find it in Socrates.  Sometimes what happened is that there is a whole code we write and there is one step I don't understand and instead of discussing this with my pairing partner to truly understand I try to keep the session going while thinking that afterwards I will go back and figure it out on my own.Reading feedback from the pair sessions helped me to identify this problem and that it is related feelings of vulnerability, insecurity and fear. I am now more intentional about not letting that problem occur by being open about the areas I have not completely understood.</p>
